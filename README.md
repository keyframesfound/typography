# Typography Word Generator

This project generates a PNG image where a target word is used as a mask filled with a pattern word. 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/) library (`pip install Pillow`)
- System fonts (or install alternatives) as defined in the code

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python word_generator.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to:
- Enter the target word.
- Enter the pattern word.
- Specify the font sizes (target: 200-2000, pattern: 12-50).

The output image will be saved as `output.png` with ultra high resolution settings.
